Scopes
1. Compile (Default) -> compile, test, runtime
2. Provided -> compile, !runtime
3. Runtime -> !compile, runtime, test
4. Test -> test
5. System -> Similar to provided, but it requires an explicit path to the JAR on the local system.
6. Import -> Special scope, which is used only for dependency management in the
        <dependencyManagement> section.
